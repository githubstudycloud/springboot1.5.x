Note:
1. For Kubernetes 1.24 and later versions, Docker support is provided through the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) using cri-dockerd.
2. Docker versions listed are the ones that were tested and known to work at the time of the Kubernetes release. Newer patch versions of Docker may also be compatible.
3. It's always recommended to check the official Kubernetes documentation for the most up-to-date compatibility information.
